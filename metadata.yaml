description: 'I am not an inquisitive woman, but when, in the middle of a certain
  warm night in September, I heard a carriage draw up at the adjoining house and stop,
  I could not resist the temptation of leaving my bed and taking a peep through the
  curtains of my window. First: because the house was empty, or supposed to be so,
  the family still being, as I had every reason to believe, in Europe; and secondly:
  because, not being inquisitive, I often miss in my lonely and single life much that
  it would be both interesting and profitable for me to know. Luckily I made no such
  mistake this evening.'
